# README

Beginning of November 2015, I decided to start this project since
I haven't completed a full decent production app in ages.
I feel like I've come a long ways as a developer and needed something to
show off my knowledge of best practices and such now.

The UI is extremely basic for now, but my primary goal with this project is
to utilize test-driven development principles to create an app with well tested, robust
models and features.

More to come soon!
